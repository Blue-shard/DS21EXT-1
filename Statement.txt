Problem Statement

Managing expenses is at the core of saving money and spending it judiciously. This project attempts at managing these expenses in an efficient manner. It includes an easy-to-use interface where the user can add, modify and remove expenses. It also allows the user to make custom plans to save money and dedicate parts of their income to specific tasks. A graphical representation allows the user to understand the inflow and outflow of finances easily, and also assists in future planning. An alert will be generated if the user's expenses exceed the amount dedicated for a task. Amount payable to bills will be deducted from the amount available to the user every month, and an alert for the payment of bills will be generated as specified by the user. At the end of the month, a report will be generated which allows the user to compare his/her goals with the results and thus, make a more stringent or lenient plan accordingly.
